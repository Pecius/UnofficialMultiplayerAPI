The API is now a part of the [RimWorld Multiplayer](https://github.com/rwmt/Multiplayer) and therefore this repository is now archived.

# Welcome!
This is an API which you can use in your mods to make them compatible with the multiplayer mod.

For more information please check the [documentation](https://pecius.github.io/UnofficialMultiplayerAPI)!

You can also find the API on Steam Workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1681596707).
